//Note 1
encodeURIComponent(//input) = returns a string and works similar to "+" operator.
  BUT if the (//input) consists of special character , the simple "+" would break whereas "encodeURIComponent" would return an encoded string .

//Note 2
Both of the below values are part of the wrapper function that wraps the entire Nodejs file as seen while debgging on Chrome
But below ones can be avoided if cross-OS functionality is required and instead use core Node Module "path" 
  _dirname = absolute path to current directory
  _filename= absolute path to current file

//Note 3
Nodemon by default checks for changes only in .js files
We can change this by adding an "-e js,hbs,......."
"-e" tag is followed by comma separated file extension to look out for


//Note 4
Deployment changes required:-
  1) Port to process.env.PORT 
  2)start script in package.json = node src/app.js
  3)Remove domain name from API call
