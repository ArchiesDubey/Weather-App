"views" folder must be named so for the Express View Engine to understand.

This directory will containe the Handlebar views

Handlebar templates are used to serve dynamic template document instead of static document from Public directory

{{}} is an handlebar syntax


If we want a custom location andd name for "views" folder, we have to configure it in "app.js" by setting the absolute path


Handlebar Partials are templates which are reusable
They are small parts of an entire html file like a <div> or a <h1> tag

To run a Partial inside a view we must use {{>}}
Partials renders property specific to that view
